DonKbot is a project that includes openscad modules to create robot chassis suitable for usage in micromouse projects such as line followers / maze runners etc following UKMARS rules. It includes many library functions to generate mounts/etc for commonly used parts and facilitates quick design of new chassis for concept testing purposes

The OpenSCAD modules in this project are dependent on the use of the lib_robo files which are available in a [separate repository here](https://github.com/dnkorte/lib_robo_core). These files may be added to the same folder as your robot project files, or may placed in a separate folder so that they may be referenced by several different projects.  OpenSCAD provides a mechanism using environment variables to facilitate the sharing of library files.
